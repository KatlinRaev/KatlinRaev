# Hi there, I'm KÃ¤tlin 

Iâ€™m making the leap from engineering to data analytics, and loving every minute of it.

### ðŸ“š Currently:
- Student at Turing College (Data Analytics)
- Completed Vali-IT Programming Course âœ…
- SQL, Excel, Agile Fundamentals (and more self-studied along the way)

### âš¡ Things I Enjoy:
- Watching sports (playing them... occasionally)
- Crime and investigations (reading, not doing)
- Coffee (probably too much, but who's counting?)

As I like to keep my workplace neat and tidy, you can find my portfolio in the [Data-Analytics-Portfolio](https://github.com/KatlinRaev/Data-Analytics-Portfolio) repository, where everything is well-organized.
