# Hi there, I'm KÃ¤tlin 

Iâ€™m making the leap from engineering to data analytics, and loving every minute of it.

### ðŸ“š Currently:
- Student at Turing College (Data Analytics)
- Completed Vali-IT Programming Course âœ…
- SQL, Excel, Agile Fundamentals (and more self-studied along the way)

### âš¡ Things I Enjoy:
- Watching sports (playing them... occasionally)
- Crime and investigations (reading, not doing)
- Coffee (probably too much, but who's counting?)

**From engineering to analytics, powered by data and caffeine.**
